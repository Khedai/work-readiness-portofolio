**Reflection (STAR):**  
Situation:
As part of the PRP370 module, we were required to create a professional CV that we could use for internships or full-time job applications after graduation.

Task:
My goal was to develop a CV that accurately reflects my qualifications, career focus, and unique skill set in multimedia and web development.

Action:
I used my academic records and personal achievements to compile a detailed CV. I included my education history, relevant IT skills, personal strengths, and languages. I made sure the layout was clean, and the content focused on my strengths in app development, web design, and problem-solving.

Result:
The final CV clearly presents who I am as an aspiring IT professional and is ready to be submitted to potential employers. It gave me more confidence in applying for roles and helped me see how far Iâ€™ve come in building a professional profile.
